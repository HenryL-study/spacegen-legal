    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: January 20, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application handles your information. Our primary goal is to provide AI-powered room editing features with maximum privacy. We believe that your private spaces should stay private.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII). We do not require a user account to use the application, and we do not collect your name, email address, or contact information.</p>

    <h2>2. Image Processing and AI</h2>
    <p>Our app allows you to upload images of your rooms for AI-driven editing. 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transient Processing:</strong> Images are used solely for the purpose of performing the requested AI edits.</li>
            <li><strong>No Storage:</strong> We do not store your original or edited images on our servers after the session is complete.</li>
            <li><strong>No Training:</strong> Your images are not used to train our AI models.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>We offer "Pro" features via In-App Purchases. All payment processing is handled securely by Apple via the App Store. We do not have access to your credit card details or billing information. We only receive a notification from Apple that a purchase was successful to unlock your features.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>While we do not collect data directly, the app is distributed through the Apple App Store, which may collect diagnostic data or usage statistics as governed by Apple's Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Because we do not collect or store user data or images, there is no data to retain or delete from our systems.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the App Store support link.</p>
